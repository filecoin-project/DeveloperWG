## Welcome! Join the conversation at [our next monthly call](https://lu.ma/n1qa6gj6). Agenda items can be added [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/DeveloperWG/issues/new/choose)!

# Developer WG (DevWG)

### Mission and Purpose
The Developer WG is a space to connect with developers, community members, researchers, and others interested in the development of new tools, technologies, and use cases that leverage the Filecoin protocol. 
The purpose of the Developer WG is to organize participants around key areas of interest to the Filecoin developer community.  By participating, community members can: 
- Share knowledge and perspective in areas that incorporate their technical or industry expertise;
- Raise challenges and questions for collective deliberation; 
- Advocate the importance of developing in specific areas of the Filecoin Network;
- Provide updates on projects and future plans within the Filecoin ecosystem, and;
- Discuss open FIPs and develop a coordinated presence in the Filecoin governance process. 

While Filecoin Foundation provides administration support to community working groups, the Developer WG is a community body that is independent of any single organization. Discussions, coordination activities, and other initiatives are carried out at the sole discretion of active working group members. The Developer WG is intended to be self-governed and self-maintained in accordance with open source best practices

### Who Should Join?

Ecosystem contributors and learners who intend to build, research or otherwise support development activities on top of the Filecoin protocol are encouraged to join! Though conversations are often technical in nature, all interested parties are welcome to participate regardless of skill set or background. 

In order to ensure alignment with the mission and purpose of the group, it is expected that all participants share a mutual interest in developing Filecoin use cases in support of Filecoinâ€™s mission. Please also note that the DevWG is entirely distinct from [Core Devs](https://github.com/filecoin-project/core-devs), a separate community group responsible for overseeing the technical development of the core Filecoin protocol. 

Working group participation is both optional and voluntary. All participants are required to adhere to the Filecoin Community Code of Conduct.  Participants found by the group to be in violation of these guidelines are subject to censorship and/or removal by the group. 

### Joining the Working Group

Participants can engage in the Developer WG through the following connection points:
- Attend Quarterly calls. 
- Join the [Builders Discussions](https://discord.com/channels/1210612276357500978/1234888399647801426) channel in Discord.
- Create an Issue in this Github repo to add a new agenda item.

The Developer WG is a means for those active or highly interested in the Filecoin ecosystem to  engage in meaningful discussion over the future of Filecoin.
